Overview of Cloud Computing
     Easy to acess
     On-Demand
     Focus on your core business
     Providers ensure maintaince
Characterisitcs of cloud computing
  self Service
  Network access
  Resource pooling -> (Virtualization machine  on host server) hyper viser is a virtualization layer.
                
  Raid Elasticity 
  Measured Service -> based on the cost you can increase or decrease 
  
  Cloud Benfits
    --> Speed & Agility
    -> Reduced Expnses
    -> Reduced costs
    -> No upfront descisions
    -> Go Global in minutes
    -> Lower Mainitaince

  Deployment Models of Cloud Computing
     -> public cloud -> shared with general public. For unpredictable utilizations by users. 
    
     -> private cloud -> dedicated lines , AWS also offering dedicated lines to company organisation
        Not able to access over the internet. 
     -> Community cloud -> some group of people can access
     -> Hybrid cloud -> Some of applications in private cloud & public cloud
     


Cloud Computing Srvice Models
  IAAS,
  PAAS
  SAAS
  ( Pizza as a service)
Regions,Availability Zones, Edge locations
Terminology
-> Scalability - Ability to handle increased workload by expaning accordning to the load
-> Fault Tolerance - Continuosly operate without interrption in the event od service failures
-> Elasticity - Capability of infrastruture to scale up or down autometically
-> Durability -> Ability to stay strong in a good condition over a long period of time.
-> Availibility -> Continue operate and provide the same service as it originally did
