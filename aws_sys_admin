 EBS Volume
 ---------
 -->persistent in nature
 -->Virtual hard disk
 --> upto 30GB-> free
 -->One EBS Volume can be attached to one instance at a time
 
 1) SSD
    2 types
      good IOPS performance
      1) General purpose (Min 1GB max:16384 GB)
         IOPS : for 100 GB-> 300/3000 ->  3 iops per GiB with minimum of 100 iops.
         
         if use less iops it will be stored in credit bucket.  upto 3000 iops can burst max
         
      2) Provisioned IOPS (min 4 GB , Max:16384 GB) -> standard 3000 iops 
 2) HDD
    3 type
    cold HDD
    Throughput optimized
    Magnetic standard -> It will not give any throughput improvement
